I have completed the full extent of the assignment, and have completed two stretch goals to reach the "A" level. 

Please read the in-browser instructions to see how this program works. It's important to note that you must select one rotation mode at a time to see the rotation on that axis. Selecting more than one will rotate on both axis.

For the C level: 
- The gasket is fully 3D
- To keep with the gasket theme, I drew a green triangle-checkered ground plane (approved by an in-lab tutor)
- The gasket is fully translateable and rotateable (see instructions for more info)

For B Level:
-I added good mouse functionality. Use Free Transform to translate the gasket with the mouse. Use the Rotate buttons and the mouse to rotate the gasket on the respective axis. See the in-browser instructions for full details.

For A level:
-I added a height variation to the plane. Simply adjust the slider to see the plane morph into a randomly-created plane of peaks and plateaus.
