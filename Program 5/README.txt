I have completed the full extent of the assignment, and have completed two stretch goals to reach the "A" level. 

Please read the in-browser instructions to see how this program works, as there's a lot of ways to operate the program (that satisfy the stretch goals)

For the C level:
-the lab still has base functionality from previous labs
-there is a 100 polygon sphere, with subdivision properties.
-there is lighting via the fragment shader using Phong/face normal shading.
-there is a togglable light (by pressing C, or button press).
-the light is able to be moved independently of the objects 


For B Level:
-I've included the additional lighting modes, including:
-gouraud
-cartoon


For A level:
-I've programmed Perlin noise shading into the fragment shader after finding
some algorthims online. It's not as nice as the book examples, as we're limited to only 100 polygons for the sphere. However, the more subdivisions, the clearer the noise. Cycle to it using the "Change Lighting" button.
