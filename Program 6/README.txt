ATTENDANCE: I have attended every lecture this quarter, including all the lectures this week and last week.

Attached is one .zip file : Lab6.zip - inside there contains gasket.html and gasket.js as well as the applied textures.

Here is a live link: http://people.ucsc.edu/~avincent/CMPS%20160/Lab6/gasket4.html

I have completed the full extent of the assignment, and have completed one stretch goal to reach the "A" level. 

Please read the in-browser instructions to see how this program works, as there's a lot of ways to operate the program (that satisfy the stretch goal)


For B Level:
-I have added a texture to both the ground plane and sphere (they share the texture, but this was approved by a lab tutor)
-There is a UI button toggle for: no texture, checkerboard texture, dirt texture, grass texture.
-There is a UI toggle button for light which makes a visible difference
-You can move the camera and the texture won't move incorrectly.
-You can move the sphere and the texture won't move incorrectly.


For A level:
-I've implemented mipmapping and interpolation via Nearest, Linear, MipMap Nearest and MipMap linear mode of texture filtering. Use the checkerboard texture to see the biggest change.

Notes: The texture's aren't large, but they might take some time to load if you're running on a slow internet connection. This should work in any browser, but it was mainly tested in Firefox. Enjoy!
